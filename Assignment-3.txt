1) Load the two csv files as DataFrame "user" & "user_engagement".
2) First process the "user" DataFrame.
3) Check for the columns having NaN values, and Null values found in last_session_creation_time and invited_by_user_id.
4) Check If the records are unique, So check if the email id is unique, we see that some of the email id appears in more than one row
   need to remomve the duplicate entries.
5) Need to change the Creation_time and last_session_creation_time to datetime objects\
6) Fill the NaN values in invited_by_user_id by 0 
7) To Fill NaN values in last_session_creation_time column, check the users login details available in engagement table, for that
   first we need to analyse the engagement table.
8) In user_engagement table not containing any null value in all the columns, but visited colum having same value '1' for all records
   So we can remove that column from the user_engagement DataFrame.
9) Need to change the time_stamp colum as datetime object.
10) Get the list of User having NaN value in the last_session_creation_time column, and check if any of the user 
    having login details in user_engagement DataFrame.
11) There are no login details available for the users with missing last_session_creation_time. So we will fill all
    missing entries with dates from creation_time, assuming that is the only time they logged into the product.
12) Check if the user and inviting user belong to the same group. For that need compare the value of org_id user and inviting user.
13) We will add two columns in user DataFrame org_size and referred. org_size with Number of users in each organization and
    referred with if the user was invited to sign in  then True else False.
14) Get the time_stamp from the user_engagement DataFrame by user.object_id and check if the entries with the same user apprears three or more 
    times in the seven days. Add the new column 'user_adopt' in user if that user appears three or more times in seven day set True otherwise False.
